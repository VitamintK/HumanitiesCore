## Introduction

Hi, I'm Kevin!  I'm currently a first-year student at UC Irvine taking a course called the Humanities Core.  In essence, this class involves delving into the humanities - reading literature, learning history, theater, art, culture - and reflecting on a theme.  This blog will contain questions and answers about the theme and what I learn and want to learn about it from the material we read.  This year, the theme is war.  

Why study war?

War is a fruitful subject to study for the humanities.  It reveals a wide variety of truths about humanity and common human processes.
War reveals things about human nature such as desires, motivations, and fears.  By studying war, we can see how people decide what to do or who to follow.
War teaches basic human desires.  War is caused by humans who want power, resources, or pride.  By studying how actors act in war, we can deduce that humans are motivated by respect on one hand and shame on the other.  And in each human, we have ingrained values of tribal solidarity that make war possible.  
From war, we can also learn lessons are human fears.  From the Iliad, we can see that soldiers are motivated by wealth, spoils of war, and glory.  More than that, they are afraid of shame, and relentlessly flee from it by diving into battle.
And war can also teach about how people decide what to do.  People choose what to do based on the culture that surrounds them.  Throughout history, cultures have had varying values that would seem ridiculous by any other culture's values.  But in each culture, all values seem normal, and falling in line with the orders is nothing but compliance.  War is also in part a product of the herd mentality.  If each person evaluated war and their role in it in a non-warring culture, the fighting and ultimate self-sacrifice would seem laughable.  However, inside a culture of war and following orders, soldiers see war as normal and there seems to be no other realistic option besides obedience.
