## Introduction

Hi, I'm Kevin!  I'm currently a first-year student at UC Irvine taking a course called the Humanities Core.  In essence, this class involves delving into the humanities - reading literature, learning history, theater, art, culture - and reflecting on a theme.  This blog will contain questions and answers about the theme and what I learn and want to learn about it from the material we read.  This year, the theme is war.  

Why study war?

War is a fruitful subject to study for the humanities.  It reveals a wide variety of truths about humanity and common human processes.
War reveals things about human nature such as desires, motivations, and fears.  By studying war, we can see how people decide what to do or who to follow.
War teaches basic human desires.  War is caused by humans who want power, resources, or pride.  By studying how actors act in war, we can deduce that humans are motivated by respect on one hand and shame on the other.  And in each human, we have ingrained values of tribal solidarity that make war possible.  
From war, we can also learn lessons are human fears.  From the Iliad, we can see that soldiers are motivated by wealth, spoils of war, and glory.  More than that, they are afraid of shame, and relentlessly flee from it by diving into battle.
And war can also teach about how people decide what to do.  People choose what to do based on the culture that surrounds them.  Throughout history, cultures have had varying values that would seem ridiculous by any other culture's values.  But in each culture, all values seem normal, and falling in line with the orders is nothing but compliance.  War is also in part a product of the herd mentality.  If each person evaluated war and their role in it in a non-warring culture, the fighting and ultimate self-sacrifice would seem laughable.  However, inside a culture of war and following orders, soldiers see war as normal and there seems to be no other realistic option besides obedience. 



## Who was Homer?  

Was there really a Homer?

For my Humanities Core class, I’ve been reading The Iliad.  In the first lecture, my professor touched upon the history and origins of the Iliad.  

In class, we discussed the historicity of the Trojan War described in the Iliad, and the factual accuracy of the epic (conclusion: it’s debatable, but it seems as if there was really a Trojan War).
However, one of the issues raised that really piqued my interest was the identity of Homer.  Professor Izenberg did not delve deeply into the question, although he did mention that Homer may or may not have been a real person, so I researched Homer on my own.  As it turns out, the identity of Homer is a well-established field of research, with its own Wikipedia article and everything.  The field is dubbed “The Homeric Question” and it concerns the existence of Homer, the identity of Homer, and the authorship of the epics.

Whether or not Homer existed isn’t a question that has been decidedly answered by anyone.  However, the name Homer is widely accepted as representing a manifestation of the ancient Greek oral tradition.  What this means is: although the works are attributed to Homer, an individual, the stories told in the epics are not the effort of a single man, but instead the result of centuries of oral storytelling passed down through generations.

This fact has an impact on how I think of the Iliad now.  Instead of attributing choices to one individual, I realized that each part of the Iliad has been touched upon and modified by hundreds of oral bards telling the story.
