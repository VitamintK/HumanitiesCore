## Introduction

#### October 10, 2014

Hi, I'm Kevin!  I'm currently a first-year student at UC Irvine taking a course called the Humanities Core.  In essence, this class involves delving into the humanities - reading literature, learning history, theater, art, culture - and reflecting on a theme.  This blog will contain questions and answers about the theme and what I learn and want to learn about it from the material we read.  This year, the theme is war.  

Why study war?

War is a fruitful subject to study for the humanities.  It reveals a wide variety of truths about humanity and common human processes.
War reveals things about human nature such as desires, motivations, and fears.  By studying war, we can see how people decide what to do or who to follow.
War teaches basic human desires.  War is caused by humans who want power, resources, or pride.  By studying how actors act in war, we can deduce that humans are motivated by respect on one hand and shame on the other.  And in each human, we have ingrained values of tribal solidarity that make war possible.  
From war, we can also learn lessons are human fears.  From the Iliad, we can see that soldiers are motivated by wealth, spoils of war, and glory.  More than that, they are afraid of shame, and relentlessly flee from it by diving into battle.
And war can also teach about how people decide what to do.  People choose what to do based on the culture that surrounds them.  Throughout history, cultures have had varying values that would seem ridiculous by any other culture's values.  But in each culture, all values seem normal, and falling in line with the orders is nothing but compliance.  War is also in part a product of the herd mentality.  If each person evaluated war and their role in it in a non-warring culture, the fighting and ultimate self-sacrifice would seem laughable.  However, inside a culture of war and following orders, soldiers see war as normal and there seems to be no other realistic option besides obedience.

## Who was Homer?  

#### October 17, 2014

Was there really a Homer?

For my Humanities Core class, I’ve been reading The Iliad.  In the first lecture, my professor touched upon the history and origins of the Iliad.  

In class, we discussed the historicity of the Trojan War described in the Iliad, and the factual accuracy of the epic (conclusion: it’s debatable, but it seems as if there was really a Trojan War).
However, one of the issues raised that really piqued my interest was the identity of Homer.  Professor Izenberg did not delve deeply into the question, although he did mention that Homer may or may not have been a real person, so I researched Homer on my own.  As it turns out, the identity of Homer is a well-established field of research, with its own Wikipedia article and everything.  The field is dubbed “The Homeric Question” and it concerns the existence of Homer, the identity of Homer, and the authorship of the epics.

Whether or not Homer existed isn’t a question that has been decidedly answered by anyone.  However, the name Homer is widely accepted as representing a manifestation of the ancient Greek oral tradition.  What this means is: although the works are attributed to Homer, an individual, the stories told in the epics are not the effort of a single man, but instead the result of centuries of oral storytelling passed down through generations.

This fact has an impact on how I think of the Iliad now.  Instead of attributing choices to one individual, I realized that each part of the Iliad has been touched upon and modified by hundreds of oral bards telling the story.

## What's the perception of the Thirty Years' War?

#### November 5, 2014

We've been reading literature pertinent to the Thirty Years' War in class lately, including the play Mother Courage (and modern performances of it) along with historical first-hand accounts.

As an American that previously knew basically nothing about the Thirty Years' War (other than its length), this made me wonder how the Thirty Years’ War is remembered today by the inhabitants of the involved areas and how it's changed since the 17th century.

My hypothesis when starting to research this was that the perception of the Thirty Years’ War in people’s minds was sure to have changed in some ways over the 300-plus years since its occurrence.

Although we in America are barely cognizant of the existence of the Thirty Years’ War, it had a huge and lasting impact on Europe and especially Germany.  It wracked the German states for 30 years, and killed 25% to 40% of the population.  As such, it must have made a deep impression on the citizens of Europe at the time.  

From von Guericke’s description of the Sack of Magdeburg, the war was a calamity for the inhabitants of Germanic states: the people of Magdeburg were robbed, beaten, massacred, and raped during the mass murder.  It was a time where people viewed others as horrible, evil, and greedy.  Grimmelshausen portrayed people as all inherently evil, in a view very much in line with the philosophy of Hobbes (who lived in the same time period).  Grimmelshausen especially represented the perpetrators of the war (the ruling class) as inherently selfish and wicked, which caused the ordinary citizens an immense amount of suffering through war.

Another interesting primary source from the time is paintings that were made of the war.  However, paintings that I found of the Thirty Years’ War are nearly all military and stoic in nature.  They try to accurately represent the military battles that occurred, and therefore most artists did not inject their own viewpoints and thoughts of the war into the paintings.  Still, I can glean information about the perception of the war through the paintings.  Nearly every piece of art about the war contains depictions of bloodshed, death, and fleeing.  Again, this is an a result of the people at the time perceiving the war as being perpetrated by bloodthirsty, cruel attackers.

I also researched the current day’s perception of the Thirty Years’ War in the same areas to see if there had been a shift in perception in the centuries since.  

Batalla de Rocroi (1643) by Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau (2013)

The war is still largely seen as one composed of bloodshed and terror.  This is due to the large amount of literature that was written during wartime, such as the primary sources I looked at above, and also the secondary works of fiction derived from those, such as Brecht’s Mother Courage, which make the war out to be a cold, cruel event.  
However, today the war is perceived in a few key ways that it wasn’t seen as in the 17th century.  Most noticeably, the war’s long-lasting political effects are appreciated now.  The Thirty Years’ War permanently changed the structure of nations in Europe immediately, and in everywhere not long after.  The residents of the 1600s who were directly involved in the bloodshed obviously couldn’t appreciate the effects that the war would have for hundreds of years, but today people see the ending of centralized ruling and the fragmentation of the European power structure, in addition to the bloody, cruel mess of the war.

## Mother Courage is Epic Theater

#### November 10, 2014

Mother Courage and her Children is a play written by Bertolt Brecht, in the epic theatre genre.  It details the journey of a woman travelling through the battlefields of the Thirty Years’ War with her children, profiting from the war, and losing her children to it.  
The attributes of a play of epic theatre emphasize the Verfremdungseffekt (distancing effect), which serve to remind the audience at all times that they are watching a play.  This is so that they do not develop an emotional attachment along with the play, which would result in emotional catharsis and not intellectual inspection during and after the conclusion of the play.  The latter is what Brecht aimed for in his play.  He wanted audience members to think about what Mother Courage says about society and war and how individual and collective action play roles in war, and how that can be changed.  

Scene Eleven is an excellent example of why Mother Courage is a play in the genre of epic theatre.  In it, we find that Mother Courage has gone into the town to “hunt for bargains”, leaving her daughter alone in a farmhouse.  The imperial army passes by the house to massacre the town (which is Protestant).  Kattrin decides to warn the town by banging a drum.  Because of this, she is shot and killed.  

The scene embodies the epic theatre genre in a few ways.  First, Brecht utilized humor throughout the grim and tense scene to interrupt the immersion of the audience.  Before the audience can start to be drawn into the scene, Brecht interrupts them with lines like “but we can pray to God and maybe because you’re a cripple He’ll listen better” to remind them that they are watching a play - to remind them that this is a play - a medium of expression, not entertainment.  
Brecht also sprinkles humor throughout the section of the scene where the soldiers attempt to get Kattrin to stop banging the drum and descend from the roof.  What would otherwise be an incredibly tense scene of suspense is changed into an almost comical comedy of errors.  For example, after a soldier unsuccessfully tried to convince Kattrin to come down from the roof, the Lieutenant spits out this gem: 
Lieutenant: You don’t believe him, you aren’t stupid, you know we’re not friends and anyway, who’d trust someone with a face like his?  But will you believe me if I give you my word as an officer of His Majesty the Emperor’s army?  My sacred word?

Kattrin drums harder.
Out of context, this could totally be a comedy.  But of course, it’s not, and Brecht simply uses these interruptions to make the audience feel less attached to the play.

  Another aspect of the play that Brecht utilized for epic theatre is blatant unrealism.  What he does to detach the audience from the play is to incorporate obviously unreal elements to remind the audience that they are watching a play.  In this scene, Brecht actually does this mostly by portraying the soldiers as highly incapable, which I mentioned above as an example of humor: They are painted as so incompetent that they become Three-Stooges-comical.  One example of this unrealism that isn’t comedy is when the soldiers attempt to drown out the sound of drumming with the sound of “a normal noise”, “a peacetime sound” - “wood chopping!” and Kattrin, along with the audience, laughs at their attempts.  Unlike an actual girl on the brink of absolutely sure death, she laughs at the humor of the soldiers’ incompetence, reminding the audience, again, that they are watching a play put on my actors and written by a playwright.

## The Prince: Sincere or Satire?

#### November 24, 2014

We all know Machiavelli.  Writer of The Prince.  Synonymous with tyranny and selfish power-thirst.  Corrupt, evil, immoral.
The Prince emphasizes the values of glory for tyrants over the well-being of their subjects.  But Machiavelli mean to advocate these actions sincerely, or was The Prince actually a backhanded satire meant to expose the evils of tyranny and principalities?

Machiavelli wrote The Prince in the form of a sort of self-help guide to instruct princes on how to rule their principalities.  In it, Machiavelli recommended many unethical means to selfish ends in an absolutely unempathetic style.  This stoich cruel and discompassionate writing style was so starkly cynical and evil that this style of power-hungry tunnelvision is known as Machiavellian.  
For example, The Prince recommended tyranny for princes. and advocate the thirst for power at the expense of the common people.  He advocates cruel and forceful action against people as means to gain and hold power.  Even when The Prince recommends moral actions for rulers, such as not stealing the property of their subjects, the reasons are always to keep power, not because of any code of ethics.  
As the author of a book that recommends such tyranny and corruptness, Machiavelli seems deserved of his title as cunning and deceitful.  However, literary scholars have recently raised an opposing thesis: that Machiavelli was in fact an opponent of tyranny and the corrupt tactics used by princes, and instead, favored republics.  This theory hypothesizes that Machiavelli wrote The Prince, not as an earnest guidebook for princes, but as a satire on the unscrupulous methods employed by princes of the time.
Machiavelli actually grew up in Florence when it was a republic.  He also served as an official in Florence during the time when it was a republic.  Hence, it’s reasonable to assume that he agreed with the principles of republics.  Diderot and Rousseau both judged The Prince to have been written as a satire.  Rousseau wrote: “Machiavelli was a proper man and a good citizen; but, being attached to the court of the Medici, he could not help veiling his love of liberty in the midst of his country's oppression. The choice of his detestable hero, Caesar Borgia, clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between the teaching of the Prince and that of the Discourses on Livy and the History of Florence shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The Court of Rome sternly prohibited his book. I can well believe it; for it is that Court it most clearly portrays.”
The Prince is never farcical enough for anyone to definitely prove that it was written as a satire, so we may very well never know what Machiavelli intended it to be.  But based on the content of the book, as well as Machiavelli’s background in Florence, it’s a pretty good guess that The Prince was meant to ridicule - not instruct - the princes of his time.
